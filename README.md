# Pennsylvania FGC Website

Finding fighting game events in the state of Pennsylvania can be difficult. The majors cities of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia are more than five hours away by car and every city in between lacks a strong voice to promote their events. Following the example of the Ohio FGC, this website serves as a central hub for players in the state of Pennsylvania to find out about the fighting game communities in their local areas and have reliable information on where to find events.

If you think something should be added to the site, get in contact with me here, on Discord (ShaolinPretzels#8711), or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shaolinpretzels).
